5. **Further Model Evaluation (Comparing Original to Predicted data)**
  - Model Accuracy: Assessing how closely the predictions match the actual values.
  - Error Analysis: Identifying patterns in the prediction errors to improve the model.
  - Bias Detection: Detecting systematic biases that may affect the predictions.
  - Trend Identification: Spoting underlying trends and patterns in the data.
  - Model Generalization: Evaluating how well the model performs on unseen data.
